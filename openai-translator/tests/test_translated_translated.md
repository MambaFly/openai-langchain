Test data
This data set contains two test samples provided by OpenAI's ChatGPT, which is an AI language model.
These samples include a Markdown table and an English text paragraph, which can be used to test English-to-Chinese translation software that supports text and table formats.
Text test: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This pangram contains at least one of every letter of the English alphabet. Pangrams are often used to test fonts, keyboards, and other text-related tools. In addition to English, many other languages also have pangrams. Due to the unique characteristics of languages, some pangrams are more difficult to construct.
